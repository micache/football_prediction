    ## **Explanation of Key Soccer Metrics:**
    - Expected Goals (xG): Measures the quality of goal-scoring chances based on factors like shot location, shot type, and build-up play. A higher xG indicates a team creates better scoring opportunities.
    - Non-Penalty Expected Goals (NPxG): Similar to xG but excludes penalties to give a clearer picture of a team's goal-scoring ability in open play.
    - Expected Goals Against (xGA): Estimates the number of goals a team is expected to concede based on the quality of chances they allow. A lower xGA suggests stronger defensive performance.
    - Non-Penalty Expected Goals Against (NPxGA): Like xGA but without penalty situations, providing a more accurate defensive assessment.
    - Non-Penalty Expected Goal Difference (NPxGD): The difference between NPxG and NPxGA, showing how well a team performs in open play. A positive value indicates better attacking than defensive performance.
    - Passes Per Defensive Action (PPDA): Measures pressing intensity by calculating how many passes an opponent completes before being disrupted. Lower PPDA means high pressing, which can disrupt opponent attacks.
    - Opponent PPDA (OPPDA): Evaluates how easily a team allows opponents to press them. A higher OPPDA suggests better ball retention and buildup under pressure.
    - Deep Completions (DC): Counts the number of passes completed within 20 yards of the opponent's goal. A higher value indicates strong attacking penetration.
    - Opponent Deep Completions (ODC): Measures how often an opponent completes passes near a team's goal. A lower value suggests stronger defensive organization.
    - Expected Points (xPTS): Predicts how many points a team should earn based on their overall performance, xG, and xGA. Helps assess whether a team is overperforming or underperforming.
    - Aerial Duels Won & Tackles Per Game: Indicates defensive robustness in duels and transitions.
    - Clean Sheet Probability: Based on past performances, estimate likelihood of a shutout.

4. **Which tactical elements from this match suggest future performance trends or strategic adaptations for both teams?**

### **Squad Data Analysis Instructions**
1. **Objective Performance Summary:** Base assessments strictly on data, avoiding subjective commentary.
2. **Impact Ranking:** Rank players by influence on the game, prioritizing metrics such as goals, assists, xG, key passes, and defensive contributions.
3. **Defensive Metrics Inclusion:** Evaluate xGA, goalkeeper performance, PPDA, and defensive duels to provide a balanced view.
4. **Finishing Efficiency:** Compare xG to actual goals to determine efficiency and potential areas of improvement.
5. **Clear Structuring:** Present findings in a structured, logical manner to enhance readability and clarity.

### **Shot Data Analysis Instructions**
1. **Performance Patterns:** Identify shot trends and their impact on overall team performance.
2. **Expected Goals (xG) Insights:** Assess xG values to measure shot quality and goal probability.
3. **Player Contributions:** Highlight key individuals in shot creation and execution.
4. **Match Context:** Explain how shot data correlates with the final result and overall tactical approach.
5. **Tactical Interpretation:** Determine if the shot distribution reflects specific strategies, such as counter-attacks or set-piece routines.
6. **Key Takeaways:** Summarize crucial insights that offer deeper understanding and predictive value for future matches.

    - Assess **home vs. away performance differences**.
    - Analyze **lineup changes compared to past matches**, checking if key players (best/star players) are missing or returning.
